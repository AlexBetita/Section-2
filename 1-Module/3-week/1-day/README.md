`My Thoughts`

- FAQ
  - What if my pair is struggling with the material?
    - Pay it forward! Try to explain concepts they struggle with.\
      Play it like you're the Senior Dev and you're helping a\
      Junior Dev understand a new concept. It'll be slow, but you can\
      flex those 'explaining muscles'.
  - What if I'M struggling with the material?
    - Be honest. Let your pair know that you're unsure of the material.\
      Be okay with trying things and being wrong.\
      Don't be embarrassed, it's normal.
  - What if BOTH of us are struggling with the material?!?
    - This WILL happen, and that's fine! The point of projects are to\
      actively LEARN, not to already know. Code until you're stuck for\
      15 mins, then call a TA in for help.
- Some important notes
  - Set up your switching system and STICK TO IT. Set alarms so you're\
    always switching between driver and navigator. Even when a TA comes in\
    makes sure you're sticking to the system.
  - If you're more experienced, don't leave your partner in the dust.\
    When you go into a job interview, you're going to be asked to explain code,\
    so get your practice in now! If you can't say, out-loud, and explain a\
    concept to your pair, maybe you don't know it as deeply as you think.
  - Be honest in your pair reports.

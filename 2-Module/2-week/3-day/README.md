### TDD Discussion

Testing Pyramid

![testing_pyramid](./testing_pyramid.png)

- Unit Tests: Smallest unit of testing. Focuses on individual functions or tasks
  individually.
- Integration Tests: Testing how seperate peices of code work with one another.
- End-to-End Tests: Tests the whole application, high level functionality, close
  to the user experience.

TDD Process

![tdd](./tdd.png)

- Red: Write tests, watch them fail
- Green: Write code, just enough to pass the previously written tests.
- Refactor: Write more tests, watch them fail, pass the tests. The loop of
  easily maintainable, fully tested, clean code.

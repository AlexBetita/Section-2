## Memory - What the h*ck is it? [10min]

## RAM
- What does it hold?
- Is it slow or fast?
- Persistent or volatile?
- Cheap or expensive?
- How do we access or refer to it?
- Only two kinds of things are truly stored in memory
## Pointers, references, etc
- What do 32-bit and 64-bit even mean?
- How much space is needed to store an address/reference/pointer on a 16/32/64-bit system?
- What is a variable?
- What is an array?
- Let's "zoom out" on Node
